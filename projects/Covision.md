## Project Description
Decentralised disease outbreak surveillance system using IPFS to efficiently manage disease reportings.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
Most of the countries need to handle their own database due to lack of a decentralised platform. This leads to complications when global data is being compiled. Being a decentralised platform handled by behind the scene Smart Contracts and IPFS provides one global platform to report medical data.
Authenticity and quality of medical data is another issue when we are being faced with pandemics. With the proper use of IPFS technology Covision has been made such that only verified individuals/organisations can write data.
