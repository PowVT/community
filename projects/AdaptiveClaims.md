## Project Description
Adaptive has created a NFT marketplace that provides incentives for responsible production and trade. Using the Adaptive web application, the supply chain actors who meet system onboarding requirements can create and exchange Adaptive Claims and Adaptive invoices. Supply chain actors who sell Adaptive Claims on the marketplace are rewarded with stablecoin tokens upon upstream transfers of the claims they helped produce. The token can be exchanged for local currency or for due diligence services.
