## Project Name 
"Responsible Minerals Claim System"

## Category 
Application


## Project Description
Adaptive Resources (https://adaptiveresources.io) has created a NFT marketplace that provides incentives for responsible production and trade. Using the Adaptive web application, the supply chain actors who meet system onboarding requirements can create and exchange Adaptive Claims and Adaptive invoices. Supply chain actors who sell Adaptive Claims on the marketplace are rewarded with xDai upon upstream transfers of the claims they helped produce. The token can be exchanged for local currency or for due diligence services.


## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
IPFS is used to store the claim documents, which record the commodity information, material properties, geographical location, and beneficiaries tied to a claim token. Claim tokens are NFTs stored on the xDai blockchain. The NFTs are sold to downstream actors in a supply chain to generate payouts for the beneficiaries of a claim.
