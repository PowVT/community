## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
We created an NFT based game which runs on the Polygon network, using Filecoin for NFT storage and powered by decentralized Chainlink Oracles. The game involves a turtle character who dodges through the platforms coming towards it with increasing speed. The NFT here is the Turtle character. Everytime a row of blocks are dodged by the turtle, 10 points are added to the score. The current game is over when the turtle collides with any of the platforms.

Inorder to dodge through the blocks, the turtle can move left or right using the arrow keys. The speed of the left and right movement of the turtle varies for each turtle NFT. The game is really fun to play and it can get really challenging as the speed of the platforms increase with time. The player is rewarded with a new random turtle NFT everytime a new checkpoint score is reached by the user. The checkpoint score is atleast 110 more than the previous high score of the player. Higher the score achieved for a new checkpoint, higher the speed of the NFT character that the user receives as a reward. More speed allows the player to move faster through the platforms and reach high score easily. Users would want to own NFTs with higher speed and hence it acts a selling point.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
